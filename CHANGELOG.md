## v0.15.1

### Bugfixes

- 2581da6 fix service propagation: handle new ClusterIPs dual-stack field

## v0.15.0

This release mainly adds support for Kubernetes 1.22+ (and OpenShift 4.9+), while dropping support for 1.20-.

### New Features

- bbbf347 add support for Kubernetes 1.22 and newer
- b5d8d8e ([@hfwen0502](https://github.com/hfwen0502), thanks!) RBAC for OpenShift, or any distribution with the [OwnerReferencesPermissionEnforcement](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#ownerreferencespermissionenforcement) admission controller enabled

### Bugfixes

- e30ba9f fix recreate delegate pod when deleted
- e23bf9b fix retry without candidate scheduler
- e97a695 fix "more than one candidate" error with self targets in multiple namespaces, and, in general, for targets using identities authorized (sometimes by mistake) in multiple namespaces
- d7d5aca fix finalizer length limit overflow for long namespace/target names

### Breaking Changes

- bbbf347 drop support for Kubernetes 1.20 and older

## v0.14.1

### Bugfixes

- 88f12af start VK server asynchronously and time out if CSR is not signed after 30s, instead of blocking before controllers could start: fixes Admiralty on EKS 1.19+, but with remote logs/exec disabled, until we upgrade dependencies to use certificates.k8s.io/v1, cf. #120
- 9af2bab add resource quota in release namespace for system-cluster-critical priority class: 0.14.0 added `priorityClassName: system-cluster-critical` to Admiralty pod to control evictions, but GKE and possibly other distributions limit its consumption by default outside the kube-system namespace; a ResourceQuota fixes that (#124)

## v0.14.0

### New Features

- 8221b3a4 and 3f84b8d0 leader election, enabled by default with 2 replicas per component

### Bugfixes

- 28ba9d2c by refactoring cross-cluster controllers from fan-out to 1-on-1, if a target is unavailable at startup, it
no longer breaks other targets while the corresponding controller is waiting for the target cache to sync (fixed #106)
- 28c126fe and e99eceed allow excluding labels from aggregation on virtual nodes, especially useful on AKS to exclude
`^kubernetes\.azure\.com/cluster=`, so kube-proxy and azure-ip-masq-agent DaemonSet don't create pods for Admiralty
virtual nodes (the manifest of those DaemonSets is reconciled by the add-on manager so adding a node anti-affinity
wasn't an option) (fixed #114)

### Internals

- 9fbada60 e2e tests for k8s versions 1.17 through 1.21 in CI; we don't support 1.22 yet, still working on its long
list of dropped API versions: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/#v1-22

## v0.13.2

### Bugfixes

- f9dce49 (@ytsarev) Update remote Ingress on annotation change.

## v0.13.1

### Bugfixes

- 0d39a1d Fix amd64 image. UPX was guilty, but we didn't notice. Disable UPX for non-amd64 images until we e2e-test all
  archs in general, and make UPX work with arm64 in particular.

## v0.13.0

### New Features

- a1c88bc Alternative scheduling algorithm, enabled with `multicluster.admiralty.io/no-reservation` pod annotation, to work with third-party schedulers in target clusters, e.g., AWS Fargate (instead of candidate scheduler).
- 7a231d3 Support cluster-level, i.e., virtual-node-level scheduling constraints, in addition (with `multicluster.admiralty.io/proxy-pod-scheduling-constraints` pod annotation) or instead of (with `multicluster.admiralty.io/use-constraints-from-spec-for-proxy-pod-scheduling` pod annotation) target-cluster-node-level scheduling constraints. To inform this new type of scheduling, aggregate target cluster node labels on virtual nodes: labels with unique values across all nodes of a target cluster, though not necessarily present on all nodes of that cluster, are added to the corresponding virtual node.

### Bugfixes

- a04da55 Fix multi-cluster service deletion.

## v0.12.0

### New Features

- 8865647 Ingresses follow services that follow matching cross-cluster pods to integrate with global ingress controllers, e.g., Admiralty Cloud.

### Bugfixes

- 3e4da1c Fix Helm chart post-delete hook. The patch was missing quotes. Uninstall would hang, with the job crash-looping.
- ec86d72 Fix service reroute, which didn't stick after service was updated or re-applied.

### Internals

- ec86d72 Refactor service controllers (reroute and global) into a new follow controller similar to the others. As a consequence, remove multicluster-controller dependency.

## v0.11.0

### New Features

- 2b696b0 Support `kubectl logs` and `kubectl exec`.
- d3832f6 Misconfigured Targets are now skipped, instead of crashing. A partially functioning system is better than failure in this case.
- 21483dc Multi-arch Docker image manifests! In addition to amd64, we now release images for arm64, ppc64le, and s390x, per user requests. Binaries are cross-compiled and untested but _should_ work. If not, please submit an issue. If you need other architectures, please submit an issue or PR.
- 21483dc Smaller images, compressed with UPX.

### Bugfixes

- c81cbc5 Allow source clusters that have the HugePageStorageMediumSize feature gate disabled (Kubernetes pre-1.19) to work with target clusters that have multiple huge page sizes.
- 2922775 Don't crash if user annotates pod but forgot to label namespace.

## v0.10.0

### New Features

- The Source CRD and controller make it easy to create service accounts and role bindings for source clusters in a target cluster. (PR #48)
- The Target CRD and controller allow defining targets of a source cluster at runtime, rather than as Helm release values. (PR #49)

### Bugfixes

- Fix name collisions and length issues (PR #56)
- Fix cross-cluster references when parent-child names differ and parent name ins longer than 63 characters, including proxy-delegate pods (PR #57)
- Fix source cluster role references (PR #58)

See further changes already listed for release candidates below.

## v0.10.0-rc.1

This release fixes cluster summary RBAC for namespaced targets. (ClusterSummary is a new CRD introduced in v0.10.0-rc.0.)

## v0.10.0-rc.0

This release fixes a couple of bugs, one [with GKE route-based clusters](https://github.com/admiraltyio/multicluster-scheduler/issues/44) (vs.VPC-native), the other [with DNS horizontal autoscaling](https://github.com/admiraltyio/multicluster-scheduler/issues/43). As a side benefit, virtual nodes capacities and allocatable resources aren't dummy high values anymore, but the sum of the corresponding values over the nodes of the target clusters that they represent. We slipped in a small UX change: when you run `kubectl get nodes`, the role column will now say "cluster" for virtual nodes, rather than "agent", to help understand concepts. Last but not least, we're upgrading internally from Kubernetes 1.17 to 1.18.

## v0.9.3

### Bugfixes

- Fix [#38](https://github.com/admiraltyio/multicluster-scheduler/issues/38). Cross-cluster garbage collection finalizers were added to all config maps and secrets, although only those that are copied across clusters actually need them. Finalizers are removed by the controller manager when config maps and secrets are terminating, so the bug wasn't major, but it did introduce unnecessary risk, because, if the controller manager went down, config maps and secrets couldn't be deleted. It could also conflict with third-party controllers of those config maps and secrets. The fix only applies finalizers to config maps and secrets that are referrred to by multi-cluster pods, and removes extraneous finalizers (no manual cleanup needed).

## v0.9.2

### Bugfixes

- The feature introduced in v0.9.0 (config maps and secrets follow pods) wasn't compatible with namespaced targets.

## v0.9.1

### Bugfixes

- f4b1936 removed proxy pod filter on feedback controller, which crashed the controller manager if normal pods were scheduled on nodes whose names were shorter than 10 characters, and added finalizers to normal pods (manual cleanup necessary!).

## v0.9.0

### New Features

- Fix [#32](https://github.com/admiraltyio/multicluster-scheduler/issues/32). Config maps and secrets now follow pods. More specifically, if a proxy pod refers to config maps or secrets to be mounted as volumes, projected volumes, used as environment variables or, for secrets, as image pull secrets, Admiralty copies those config maps or secrets to the target cluster where the corresponding delegate pod runs.

## v0.8.2

Note: we're skipping v0.8.1 because the 0.8.1 image tag was erroneously used for a pre-release version.

### Bugfixes

- Fix [#20](https://github.com/admiraltyio/multicluster-scheduler/issues/20). Scheduling was failing altogether if the namespace didn't exist in one of the target clusters. That cluster is now simply filtered out.
- Fix [#21](https://github.com/admiraltyio/multicluster-scheduler/issues/21). The feedback controller wasn't compatible with namespaced targets. It was trying to watch remote pod chaperons at the cluster level, which wasn't allowed by remote RBAC.
- Fix [#25](https://github.com/admiraltyio/multicluster-scheduler/issues/25). The Helm chart values structure was broken, making it difficult to set resource requests/limits.
- Fix [#26](https://github.com/admiraltyio/multicluster-scheduler/issues/26). Init containers weren't stripped from their service account token volume mounts as pods were delegated.
- Fix a race condition that allowed candidate pod chaperons and their pods to be orphaned if scheduling failed. Finalizer is now added to proxy pods at admission vs. asynchronously by the feedback controller.

### Breaking Changes

- Some Helm chart values were broken (see above). As we fixed them, we reorganized all values, so some values that did work now work differently.

## v0.8.0

This release removes the central scheduler, replaced by a decentralized algorithm creating candidate pods in all targets (of which only one becomes the proxy pod's delegate). See the [proposal](proposals/decentralized.md) for details.

### New Features

- Advanced scheduling: all Kubernetes standard scheduling constraints are now respected, not just node selectors, but affinities, etc., because the candidate scheduler uses the Kubernetes [scheduling framework](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-scheduling/20180409-scheduling-framework.md).
- There's now one virtual node per target, making it possible to drain clusters, e.g., for blue/green cluster upgrades.
- Delegate pods are now controlled by intermediate pod chaperons. This was a technical requirement of the new scheduling algorithm, with the added benefit that if a delegate pod dies (e.g., is evicted) while its cluster is offline, a new pod will be created to replace it.

### Breaking Changes

- _Invitations_ have been removed. The user is responsible for creating service accounts for sources in target clusters. Only the `multicluster-scheduler-source` cluster role is provided, which can be bound to service accounts with cluster-scoped or namespaced role bindings.
- You can no longer enforce placement with the `multicluster.admiralty.io/clustername` annotation. Use a more idiomatic node selector instead.

### Internals

- We've started internalizing controller runtime logic (for the new feedback and pod chaperon controllers), progressively decoupling multicluster-scheduler from [controller-runtime](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime) and [multicluster-controller](https://github.com/admiraltyio/multicluster-controller), to be more agile.

## v0.7.0

This release simplifies the design of multicluster-scheduler to enable new features: removes observations and decisions (and all the finalizers that came with them), replaces _federations_ (two-way sharing) by _invitations_ (one-way sharing, namespaced), adds support for node selectors.

### Breaking Changes

- Because the scheduler now watches and creates resources in the member clusters directly, rather than via observations and decisions, those clusters' Kubernetes APIs must be routable from the scheduler. If your clusters are private, please file an issue. We could fix that with tunnels.
- The multi-federation feature was removed and replaced by invitations.
- "Cluster namespaces" (namespaces in the scheduler's cluster that held observations and decisions) are now irrelevant.

### New Features

- Support for standard Kubernetes node selectors. If a multi-cluster pod has a node selector, multicluster-scheduler will ensure that the target cluster has nodes that match the selector.
- Invitations. Each agent specifies which clusters are allowed to create/update/delete delegate pods and services in its cluster and optionally in which namespaces. The scheduler respects invitations in its decisions, and isn't even authorized to bypass them.

### Bugfixes

- Fix [#17](https://github.com/admiraltyio/multicluster-scheduler/issues/17). The agent pod could not be restarted because it had a finalizer AND was responsible for removing its own finalizer. The agent doesn't have a finalizer anymore (because we got rid of observations).
- Fix [#16](https://github.com/admiraltyio/multicluster-scheduler/issues/16). Proxy pods were stuck in `Terminating` phase. That's because they had a non-zero graceful deletion period. On a normal node, it would be the kubelet's responsibility to delete them with a period of 0 once all containers are stopped. On a virtual-kubelet node, it is the implementation's responsibility to do that. Our solution is to mutate the graceful deletion period of proxy pods to 0 at admission, because the cross-cluster garbage collection pattern with finalizers is sufficient to ensure that they are deleted only after their delegates are deleted (and the delegates' containers are stopped).

## v0.6.0

### New Features

- Multicluster-scheduler is now a virtual-kubelet provider. Proxy pods are scheduled to a virtual node rather than actual nodes:
  - Their containers no longer need to be replaced by dummy signal traps, because they aren't run locally.
  - A proxy pod's status is simply the copy of its delegate's status. Therefore, it appears pending as long as its delegate is pending (fixes [#7](https://github.com/admiraltyio/multicluster-scheduler/issues/7)).
  - Finally, proxy pods no longer count toward the pod limit of actual nodes.
- Merge `cmd/agent` and `cmd/webhook`, and run virtual-kubelet as part of the same process. This reduces the number of Kubernetes deployments and Helm subcharts. If we need to scale them independently in the future, we can easily split them again.

### Bugfixes

- Add missing post-delete Helm hook for scheduler resources, to delete finalizers on pod and service observations and decisions.

### Internals

- Upgrade controller-runtime to v0.4.0, because v0.1.12 wasn't compatible with virtual-kubelet (their dependencies weren't). As a result, **[cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) is now a pre-requisite**, because certificate generation for webhooks has been removed as of controller-runtime v0.2.0.

## v0.5.0

### New Features

- Sensible defaults to make configuration easier:
  - `agent.remotes[0].secretName=remote` in Helm chart
  - clusterNamespace defaults to cluster name in Helm chart and `pkg/config`

### Bugfixes

- Fix [#13](https://github.com/admiraltyio/multicluster-scheduler/issues/13): Post-delete hook job ensures finalizers used for cross-cluster garbage collection are removed when multicluster-scheduler is uninstalled. Previously, those finalizers had to be removed by the user.

### Internals

- Align chart (and subcharts) versioning with main project for simplicity, because they are released together.

### Documentation

- [Helm chart documentation](charts/multicluster-scheduler/README.md)

## v0.4.0

### New Features

- Helm charts (v3) for an easier and more flexible installation
- Multi-federation that works!
- Better RBAC with cluster namespaces: as an option, you can setup multicluster-scheduler so that each member cluster has a dedicated namespace in the scheduler cluster for observations and decisions. This makes it possible for partially trusted clusters to participate in the same federation (they can send pods to one another, via the scheduler, but they cannot observe one another).
- More observations (to support non-basic schedulers, including Admiralty's advanced scheduler)

### Bugfixes

- Don't spam the log with update errors like "the object has been modified; please apply your changes to the latest version and try again". The controller would back off and retry, so the log was confusing. We now just ignore the error and let the cache enqueue a reconcile request when it receives the latest version (no back-off, but for that, the controller must watch the updated resource).

### Internals

- Use `gc` pattern from [multicluster-controller](https://github.com/admiraltyio/multicluster-controller) for cross-cluster/cross-namespace garbage collection with finalizers for `send`, `receive`, and `bind` controllers. (As a result, the local `EnqueueRequestForMulticlusterController` handler in `receive` was deleted. It now exists in multicluster-controller.)
- Split `bind` controller from `schedule` controller, to more easily plug in custom schedulers.
- `send` controller uses `unstructured` to support more observations.
- Switch to Go modules
- Faster end-to-end tests with [KIND (Kubernetes in Docker)](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) rather than GKE.
- Stop using skaffold (build images once in `build.sh`) and kustomize (because we now use Helm).
- Split `delegatestate` controller (in scheduler manager) from `feedback` controller (in agent manager) to make cluster namespace feature possible (where cluster1 cannot see observations from cluster2).
- The source cluster name of an observation is either its namespace (in cluster namespace mode) or the cross-cluster GC label `multicluster.admiralty.io/parent-clusterName`. The target cluster name of a decision is either its namespace (in cluster namespace mode) or the `multicluster.admiralty.io/clustername` annotation (added by `bind` and `globalsvc`). `status.liveState.metadata.ClusterName` is not longer used, except when it's backfilled in memory at the interface with the basic scheduler, which still uses the field internally.
